# GistPad

[![Join space](https://vslscommunitieswebapp.azurewebsites.net/badge/gistpad)](http://vslscommunitieswebapp.azurewebsites.net/join_redirect/gistpad)

GistPad is a Visual Studio Code extension that allows you to develop [GitHub Gists](https://gist.github.com/) entirely from within the editor. You can open, create, delete and fork Gists, and then seamlessly begin editing files, as if they were local. It's like your very own, cloud-based scratchpad and code snippet manager. Additionally, you can collaborate with your friends and colleagues by "following" them, so that you can access/browse/fork and comment on their Gists, directly from within Visual Studio Code ðŸš€

## Getting Started

1. Install this extension from the marketplace

   > **Linux Users**: Ensure you have the `gnome-keyring` and `libsecret` packages installed as well. These will enable GistPad to read/write your GitHub auth token securely.

   > **GitHub Enterprise users**: Set the `gistpad.apiUrl` setting to point at the API URL of your GitHub server instance (e.g. `https://[YOUR_HOST]/api/v3`).

1. Open the `Explorer` tab and expand the `Gists` view. From there, you can open a Gist by ID/URL, or sign-in in wth a GitHub token, in order to view/edit/create/delete Gists.

   > In order to generate a new token, simply visit [this page](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new), give it a name (e.g. `gistpad`), and then check the `gist` checkbox.

1. Add existing files to your Gists by right-clicking them in the `Explorer` tree, or right-clicking an editor window, and selecting `Add Document to Gist`, `Add Selection to Gist` or `Paste Gist File` ([details](#contributed-commands-editor))

1. View and reply to comments in a Gist by scrolling to the bottom of a Gist file interacting with the thread

1. Stay up-to-date with your friend's and colleague's Gists by following them via the `GistPad: Follow User` command

## Gist Commenting

Gist comments are exposed within the editor at the bottom of any opened Gist files. If a Gist includes multiple files, then the comment thread will be displayed at the bottom of them all (duplicated and synchronized).

If you're not authenticated, you can view existing comments, but you can't reply to them. If you are authenticated, you can add/reply, as well as edit/delete your own comments.

## Paste Screenshots

Paste screenshots from your clipboard into the gist:

 - From the editor's context menu: `Paste Screenshot` command (this only appears within GistPad-managed markdown files).
 - From command palette: `GistPad: Paste Screenshot` command.
 - Keyboard shortcut:
   - Windows/Linux: `ctrl + shift + v`
   - Mac OSx: `cmd + shift + v`

By default the screenshot gets uploaded as a `.png` file to the gist and the link is added to the gist as `Markdown` image markup. The behaviour can be changed using the follow settings:

- `Gistpad: Paste Screenshot Type`:

  - `file` (default): the screenshot is `uploaded` as a `.png` file to the gist.
  - `base64`: the screenshot is `base64`-embedded into the gist.

- `Gistpad: Paste Screenshot Output`

  - `markdown` (default): the `Markdown` format is used for the image markup, e.g. `![image](link)`.
  - `html`: the `HTML` format is used for the image markup, e.g. `<img src="link" />`.

## Contributed Commands (File Explorer)

In addition to the `Gists` view, GistPad also contributes an `Add Document to Gist` command to the context menu of the `Explorer` file tree, which allows you to easily add local files to an existing or new Gist.

## Contributed Commands (Editor)

In addition to the `Explorer` file tree commands, GistPad also contributes the following commands to the editor's context menu:

- `Add Document to Gist` - Same behavior as the equivalent command in the `Explorer` tree

- `Add Selection to Gist` - Allows you to add a snippet/selection of code to a Gist, instead of the entire document

- `Paste Gist File` - Allows you to paste the contents of a Gist file into the active document

## Contributed Commands (Command Palette)

In addition to the `Gists` view, this extension also provides the following commands:

- `GistPad: Follow User` - Follow another GitHub user, whuich allows you to browser/access/fork their Gists from within the `Gists` view.

- `GistPad: Paste Screenshot` - Paste screenshot from the clipboard.

- `GistPad: Open Gist` - Displays your list of Gists (if you're signed in), and then opens the files for the selected one. You can also specify a Gist ID directly, which doesn't require being signed in.

- `GistPad: Open Gist as Workspace` - Same behavior as the `GistPad: Open Gist` command, but will open the selected Gist as a workspace, istead of "loose files".

- `GistPad: New Gist` - Creates a new [public Gist](https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.13/user/articles/about-gists#public-gists), and then opens its associated files. If you'd like to seed the gist with multiple files, you can specify a comma-seperated list of names (e.g. `foo.txt,bar.js`).

- `GistPad: New Gist (Secret)` - Same behavior as the `GistPad: New Gist (Public)` command, except that it creates a [secret Gist](https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.13/user/articles/about-gists#secret-gists).

- `GistPad: Delete Gist` - Allows you to delete one of your Gists. If you have a Gist workspace open, it will delete that and then close the folde

- `GistPad: Starred Gists` - Lists your starred Gists, and then opens the files for the selected one.

- `GistPad: Fork Gist` - Forks the currently opened Gist, and then opens it as a virtual workspace.

- `GistPad: Sign In` - Sign-in with a GitHub token, in order to view/edit/delete your Gists.

- `GistPad: Sign Out` - Sign out of the currently authenticated GitHub session.

## Configuration Settings

- `Gistpad: Api Url` - Specified the GitHub API server to use. By default, this points at GitHub.com (`https://api.github.com`), but if you're using GitHub Enterprise, then you need to set this to the v3 API URL of your GitHub server. This should be something like `https://[YOUR_HOST]/api/v3`.

- `Gistpad: Paste Screenshot Type`:

  - `file` (default): the screenshot is `uploaded` as a `.png` file to the gist.
  - `base64`: the screenshot is `base64`-embedded into the gist.

- `Gistpad: Paste Screenshot Output`

  - `markdown` (default): the `Markdown` format is used for the image markup, e.g. `![image](link)`.
  - `html`: the `HTML` format is used for the image markup, e.g. `<img src="link" />`.

## Shortcuts

- `Paste Screenshot` command:

   - Windows/Linux: `ctrl + shift + v`
   - Mac OSx: `cmd + shift + v`

## Supported Filesystem Operations

Once you've opened a Gist, you can perform the following filesystem operations:

- Editing existing files
- Adding new files
- Renaming files
- Deleting files
- Copying/pasting files

> GitHub Gist doesn't support directories, and therefore, this extension doesn't allow you to create them.

## Recommended Extensions

In order to improve the productivity of editing Gists, and make VS Code behave similarly to the GitHub.com experience, the following extensions are recommended, depending on how you expect to use Gists (e.g. markdown files, code snippets):
